		po[1]={auth:'Robert Frost',nam:'Nothing Gold Can Stay', txt:'Natures first green is gold<br>Her hardest hue to hold<br>Her early leafs a flower<br>But only so an hour<br><br>Then leaf subsides to leaf<br>So eden sank to grief<br>So dawn goes down to day<br>Nothing gold can stay '};
		po[2]={auth:'Pai Ta-shun',nam:"The Artist's Precept", txt:"I would not paint a face<br>Or rocks or streams of trees -<br>Mere semblances of things - <br>But something more than these.<br>I would not play a tune<br>Upon the sheng or lute,<br>Which did not also sing<br>Meanings that else were mute.<br>That art is best which gives<br>To the soul's range no bound;<br>Something beside the form,<br>Something beyond the sound."};
		po[3]={auth:'Robert Frost',nam:'Lodged', txt:"The rain to the wind said,<br>'You push I'll pelt.'<br>They so smote the garden bed<br>That the flowers actually knelt,<br>And lay lodged--though not dead.<br>I know how the flowers felt."};

		po[6]={auth:'Robert Frost',nam:'Dust of Snow',txt:"The way a crow<br>Shook down on me<br>The dust of snow<br>From a hemlock tree<br><br>Has given my heart<br>A change of mood<br>And saved some part<br>Of a day I had rued."};
		po[7]={auth:'Robert Frost',nam:'The Rose Family',txt:"The rose is a rose,<br>And was always a rose.<br>But the theory now goes<br>That the apple's a rose,<br>And the pear is, and so's<br>The plum, I suppose.<br>The dear only knows<br>What will next prove a rose.<br>You, of course, are a rose --<br>But were always a rose."};
		po[8]={auth:'Walt Whitman',nam:'Beginners',txt:"How they are provided for upon the earth, (appearing at intervals,)<br>How dear and dreadful they are to the earth,<br>How they inure to themselves as much as to any -- what a paradox appears their age,<br>How people respond to them, yet know them not,<br>How there is something relentless in their fate all times,<br>How all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward,<br>And how the same inexorable price must be paid for the same great purchase."};

Oh, that's all very well,<br>But where's the old friend hasn't fallen off,<br>Or slacked his hand grip when you first gripped fame?<br>I know your circle and can fairly tell<br>What you have kept and what you have left behind:<br>I know my circle and know very well<br>How many faces I'd have out of mind."};
